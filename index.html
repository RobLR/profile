            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>My name is Robert Le Roux and I'm currently based in Leeds. I have recently completed a Tech Talent Accelerator pre apprenticeship with the aim of getting an apprenticeship or junior developer role.</p>
            <p>As a tech enthusiast I was drawn to computer science at GCSE level where I first experienced coding in Python and some basic HTML. After my A levels I started a Geology degree during which I chose modules involving statistical analysis with R and a module using GIS, which I used in further university projects.</p>
            <p>I realised I wasn't enjoying Geology that much and decided to stop my course and started looking for ways into software engineering.</p>

            <h3>Tech Talent Accelerator (22/11/2021 - 14/01/2022)</h3>
            <p>This was a 6-week bootcamp aimed at teaching people the basics to get into careers in software development. The first two weeks began with teaching some computing fundamentals, an introduction to Agile and GIT, followed by HTML and CSS. For the following four weeks I focused on JavaScript, and then TypeScript to create various projects using local storage, the fetch API, DOM manipulation, classes and object-oriented programming. This culminated in a week long group project where we used GIT and Live Share to work together to make a text based adventure game and adventure game creator.</p>

                        <p>This was the final group project from my Generation UK bootcamp. It was completed over a week and intended to be a way to play and create text based adventure games. It involved combining all of the things we'd learnt on the course. I was mainly responsible for the JavaScript side of things, however I did help with some HTML and CSS as well. The biggest challenges we faced were being able to link locations back to each other and storing things within other things while still making them available to be referenced. We achieved this using object oriented programming and classes.</p>
